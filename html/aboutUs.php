Owners Sam and Nellie Pickford had spotted a growing fashion for day trips to the seaside and countryside. 
This growing sideline was briefly curtailed by the war, but after resuming in 1947 became increasingly popular.
</p>
<p>
The Pickfords' travel business grew during the package holiday boom of the 1950s and 60s, when a week's holiday to Corsica,
Sardinia or the Costa Brava started coming within reach the average family. 
The business became a limited company in 1962 and was re-named S&N Pickford (Romiley) Ltd. as a nod to Sam and Nellie,
who had first seen the potential of travel sales. Day-to-day running of the company was now 
in the hands of their daughter Marjorie and her husband Ian.
</p>
<p>
In 1969 Marjorie and Ian were joined by daughter Alison and son-in-law Alan, 
who worked alongside them until their retirement in 1990. Over that period the company evolved from selling package
holidays to specialising in tailor-made and business travel.
</p>
<p>
Alison and Alan Skirvin continue to run the family business and were joined by youngest daughter Zara in 2008. 
They are accompanied by a loyal team of staff, many of whom have been with the company for over a decade.
